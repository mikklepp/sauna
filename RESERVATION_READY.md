## Key Differences from Individual Flow

| Feature | Individual | Shared |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Color Theme** | Blue | Purple |
| **Steps** | 3 (Boat/Party/Confirm) | 4 (Details/Boat/Party/Confirm) |
| **Time Selection** | Next available only | Pre-set schedule |
| **Validation** | Daily limit | Daily limit + duplicate check |
| **Preview** | Next slot info | Participant list |
| **Schedule** | 1 hour slot | Gender-specific times |

## API Integration

Uses Phase 2 endpoints:
- `GET /api/shared-reservations?saunaId=xxx` - Get shared reservation
- `GET /api/boats/search?q=xxx` - Search boats
- `GET /api/boats/[id]/daily-limit` - Check availability
- `POST /api/shared-reservations/[id]/join` - Join reservation

## Visual Distinction

**Purple branding** throughout:
- Purple buttons (`bg-purple-600`)
- Purple badges and highlights
- Purple progress indicators
- Purple success screen
- Purple schedule cards

This makes it instantly recognizable as a shared (vs individual) reservation.
